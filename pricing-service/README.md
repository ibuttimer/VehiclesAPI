# Pricing Service

The Pricing Service is a REST WebService that simulates a backend that
would store and retrieve the price of a vehicle given a vehicle id as
input. In this project, you will convert it to a microservice.


## Features

- REST WebService integrated with Spring Boot

## Instructions

#### TODOs

- Convert the Pricing Service to be a microservice.
- Add an additional test to check whether the application appropriately generates a price for a given vehicle ID

#### Run the code

To run this service you execute:

```
$ mvn clean package
```

```
$ java -jar target/pricing-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
In a Windows environment, it may be build and run using
```
> build.cmd
```
and
```
> run.cmd
```

It can also be imported in your IDE as a Maven project.
